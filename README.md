# Facial Recognition and Gender Classification

Welcome to our Facial Recognition and Gender Classification repository! In this project, we have explored and implemented various machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 
with both PyTorch and TensorFlow, and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Our work was conducted using Google Colab, making it accessible and easy to run for anyone interested in exploring or extending our research.

## Repository Structure

- **CNN_PyTorch:** This directory contains the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks using PyTorch for facial recognition. Detailed instructions and information about the model are provided in the [README](Readme_CNNPytorch.txt) file within the directory.

- **CNN_TensorFlow:** Similar to the PyTorch version, this directory holds the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks using TensorFlow. Check the (Abraham pls add)file for comprehensive guidance on running and understanding the TensorFlow-based model.

- **KNN:** Here, you will find the k-Nearest Neighbors implementation for facial recognition. Refer to the [README](/knn-model/knn-fer/README_KNN.md) file within the directory for detailed instructions on running the KNN model.

- **SVM:** This directory includes the Support Vector Machines implementation for facial recognition. See the [README](SVM/README.md) file for instructions on running the SVM model.

- **Gender_Classification:** This directory encompasses a unified file for gender classification, implementing CNN, KNN, and SVM in the same script. The [README](README_gender.md) file provides specific instructions for running each classification model within the file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (for local development)
- PyTorch and/or TensorFlow (depending on the models you want to run)
- Other necessary libraries (requirements specified in each README file)

### Running the Models

1. Clone this repository:

2. Navigate to the desired directory
3. Follow the instructions in the respective README file for each model to set up and run the code.
